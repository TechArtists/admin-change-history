# Change History Sheet

This is an example model of a sheet that you can manually populate to keep track of changes that affect your business. They can either be app releases, backend relesaes, marketing changes (e.g. incrementing budget, changing visuals), outages, external changes, etc.

To keep things simple to use, it uses two sheets, a "Recent Changes" one, that only contains changes from the last 14 days and a "Historical" one.

You can look at an example template sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZBUeefx5cMomx53adNwjsrCVj5Rd7rBBp2OYAjDQYQo/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

# üóÇ Move "Recent Changes" -> "Historical" Script

This repo has a Python script that moves "old" rows from **"Recent Changes"** into the a **"Historical"** sheet.
It identifies old rows by looking at the **"Change Timestamp"** column and moving those older than 14 days.
It also removes empty rows from the Recent Changes sheet to keep data compact.

## üìä Example Spreadsheet Format

Your Google Spreadsheet must have a sheet named **"Recent Changes"** with the following columns:

| Product Name   | Version | Change Name | Change Details | Change Timestamp            | End Change Timestamp | Change Type  | Component | Platform | Link | Comments |
|----------------|---------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|-----------|----------|------|----------|
| Product Name 1 | 112.12.12 | Testing     |                | 2025-05-01T17:34:00+03:00    | 2025-05-22            | Full Rollout | Marketing | All      |      |          |
| Product Name 2 |           | Deploying   | | 2025-03-27              |                       | Full Rollout | Marketing | All      |      |          |

‚úÖ The `Change Timestamp` column must exist and be in one of these formats:
- ISO 8601: `2025-05-01T17:34:00+03:00` or `2025-05-01T17:34:00Z`
- US-style: `05/01/2025 17:34:00`

## üõ† Script Behavior

- Moves rows from "Recent Changes" to "Historical" if the `Change Timestamp` is older than 14 days
- Keeps the header intact
- Removes gaps in "Recent Changes" by shifting non-empty rows upward
